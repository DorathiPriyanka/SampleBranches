    In Java, we can create our own exceptions that are derived classes of the Exception class. <br> 
     Creating our own Exception is known as custom exception or user-defined exception. <br> Basically, Java custom exceptions are used to customize the exception according to user need. <br>

Consider the example 1 in which InvalidAgeException class extends the Exception class. <br>

Using the custom exception, we can have your own exception and message. <br> Here, we have passed a string to the constructor of superclass i.e. Exception class that can be obtained using getMessage() method on the object we have created.
